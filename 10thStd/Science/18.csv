Fill in the Blanks,The organs which are different in origin but similar in function are called _______ organs.,analogous
Fill in the Blanks,The remains or traces of dead plants and animals are called _______.,fossils
Fill in the Blanks,The development of different species from a common ancestor is called _______.,speciation
True or False,Evolution is a gradual process.,True
True or False,Fossils are found only in sedimentary rocks.,True
True or False,Wings of birds and insects are homologous organs.,False
True or False,Natural selection leads to adaptation.,True
True or False,Mutation is the only source of variation.,False
Answer Briefly,What is organic evolution?,Organic evolution is the gradual development of complex organisms from pre-existing simple organisms through natural selection over millions of years.
Answer Briefly,Define fossils.,Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of animals plants and other organisms that lived in the geological past.
Answer Briefly,What is natural selection?,Natural selection is the process by which organisms with favorable variations survive and reproduce while those with unfavorable variations are eliminated.
Answer in Detail,Explain Darwin's theory of evolution.,Darwin's theory of evolution: 1. Overproduction and struggle for existence 2. Variations within population 3. Natural selection and survival of the fittest 4. Inheritance of favorable variations 5. Formation of new species through gradual changes over generations. Evidence from fossils comparative anatomy embryology and biogeography.
Answer in Detail,Describe the evidences for evolution.,Evidences for evolution: 1. Fossils show gradual changes over time 2. Homologous organs indicate common ancestry 3. Analogous organs show adaptive evolution 4. Vestigial organs represent unused inherited features 5. Embryological studies reveal evolutionary relationships. Examples include vertebrate limbs human appendix and whale pelvic bones.
