Example: Mirror reflection. Refraction: When light changes direction while passing through different media. Example: A pencil appearing bent in water. Dispersion: When white light splits into its component colors. Example: Formation of rainbow. Total Internal Reflection: When light is completely reflected within a denser medium. Example: Optical fibers.{next}Describe the structure and function of human eye.{ans}The human eye consists of: 1. Cornea - Transparent outer covering that refracts light. 2. Lens - Adjusts its shape to focus images. 3. Retina - Light-sensitive layer where images form. 4. Iris - Controls amount of light entering eye. 5. Optic Nerve - Carries visual signals to brain. Functions include: focusing objects at different distances adaptation to light intensity and color perception.
