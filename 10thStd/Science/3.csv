Answer Briefly,What is meant by electric current?,Electric current is defined as the rate of flow of electric charges through a conductor.
Answer Briefly,State Ohm's law.,Ohm's law states that the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference across its ends provided the temperature remains constant.
Answer in Detail,Explain the factors affecting resistance of a conductor.,The resistance of a conductor depends on: 1. Length: Directly proportional to length. 2. Cross-sectional area: Inversely proportional to area. 3. Nature of material: Depends on resistivity. 4. Temperature: Generally increases with temperature for conductors. Formula: R = ρL/A where ρ is resistivity L is length and A is area.
Answer in Detail,Describe the heating effects of electric current and its applications.,Heating effects occur when current flows through a resistor converting electrical energy to heat. Applications include: 1. Electric iron: Uses nichrome heating element. 2. Electric kettle: Converts electrical energy to heat energy to boil water. 3. Electric toaster: Uses high resistance wire to produce heat. 4. Electric heater: Converts electrical energy to heat for room heating. The heat produced depends on: current squared resistance and time (H = I²Rt).
