Length: Directly proportional to length. 2. Cross-sectional area: Inversely proportional to area. 3. Nature of material: Depends on resistivity. 4. Temperature: Generally increases with temperature for conductors. Formula: R = ρL/A where ρ is resistivity L is length and A is area.{next}Describe the heating effects of electric current and its applications.{ans}Heating effects occur when current flows through a resistor converting electrical energy to heat. Applications include: 1. Electric iron: Uses nichrome heating element. 2. Electric kettle: Converts electrical energy to heat energy to boil water. 3. Electric toaster: Uses high resistance wire to produce heat. 4. Electric heater: Converts electrical energy to heat for room heating. The heat produced depends on: current squared resistance and time (H = I²Rt).
