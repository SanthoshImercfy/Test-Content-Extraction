Fill in the Blanks,The upward movement of water in plants against gravity is called _______.,ascent of sap
Fill in the Blanks,The loss of water in the form of water vapour through stomata is called _______.,transpiration
Fill in the Blanks,Blood cells are produced in _______.,bone marrow
Fill in the Blanks,The normal blood pressure is _______.,120/80 mmHg
Fill in the Blanks,_______ carries oxygenated blood from lungs to heart.,pulmonary vein
True or False,Root pressure helps in the transport of water in plants.,True
True or False,Transpiration pull theory explains the ascent of sap in plants.,True
True or False,Platelets help in blood clotting.,True
True or False,The human heart is four-chambered.,True
True or False,Arteries carry deoxygenated blood.,False
Answer Briefly,What is root pressure?,Root pressure is the positive pressure that develops in the roots of plants causing the water to rise up through the xylem.
Answer Briefly,Define transpiration.,Transpiration is the loss of water in the form of water vapor from aerial parts of the plant especially through stomata.
Answer Briefly,What is blood pressure?,Blood pressure is the force exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels especially arteries.
Answer in Detail,Explain the process of transport of water in plants.,Transport of water in plants: 1. Absorption through root hairs by osmosis 2. Movement through cortex via symplast and apoplast pathways 3. Selective transport through endodermis 4. Entry into xylem vessels 5. Upward movement due to root pressure and transpiration pull 6. Distribution to all parts through vascular system.
Answer in Detail,Describe the structure and working of human heart.,Human heart structure and working: 1. Four-chambered muscular organ with two atria and two ventricles 2. Right side receives deoxygenated blood left side receives oxygenated blood 3. Valves prevent backflow of blood 4. Systole and diastole create pumping action 5. Pulmonary and systemic circulation maintain blood flow throughout body.
