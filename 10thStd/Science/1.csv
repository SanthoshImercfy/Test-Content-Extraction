Answer Briefly,What is refractive index?,Refractive index gives us an idea of how fast or how slow light travels in a medium
Answer Briefly,State Snell's law,The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence and sine of the angle of refraction is equal to the ratio of refractive indices of the two media. This law is also known as Snell's law
Answer Briefly,What is meant by dispersion of light?,The phenomenon of splitting of visible light into its component colors is known as dispersion of light
Answer Briefly,What is meant by refraction of light?,The change in the path of light when it travels from one transparent medium to another transparent medium is called refraction of light
Answer Briefly,What is the cause for twinkling of stars?,The twinkling of stars is due to atmospheric refraction of star light
Answer Briefly,What are the types of lenses?,The types of lenses are convex lens (converging lens) and concave lens (diverging lens)
Answer Briefly,Define power of a lens,Power of a lens is defined as the reciprocal of its focal length in meters. Power of a lens = 1/focal length (in metres)
