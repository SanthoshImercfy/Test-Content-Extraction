Fill in the Blanks,The path of the light is called as _______.,ray
Fill in the Blanks,The refractive index of a transparent medium is always greater than _______.,unity
Fill in the Blanks,If the energy of incident beam and the scattered beam are same then the _______ scattering of light is called as scattering _______.,elastic
Fill in the Blanks,According to Rayleigh's scattering law the amount of scattering of light is inversely proportional to the fourth power of its _______.,wavelength
Fill in the Blanks,Amount of light entering into the eye is controlled by _______.,iris
True or False,Velocity of light is greater in denser medium than in rarer medium.,False
True or False,The power of lens depends on the focal length of the lens.,True
True or False,Increase in the converging power of eye lens cause 'hypermetropia'.,True
True or False,The convex lens always gives small virtual image.,False
Answer Briefly,What is refractive index?,Refractive index gives us an idea of how fast or how slow light travels in a medium.
Answer Briefly,State Snell's law.,The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence and sine of the angle of refraction is equal to the ratio of refractive indices of the two media.
Answer in Detail,Explain the types of optical phenomena with examples.,Reflection: When light bounces back from a surface. Example: Mirror reflection. Refraction: When light changes direction while passing through different media. Example: A pencil appearing bent in water. Dispersion: When white light splits into its component colors. Example: Formation of rainbow. Total Internal Reflection: When light is completely reflected within a denser medium. Example: Optical fibers.
Answer in Detail,Describe the structure and function of human eye.,The human eye consists of: 1. Cornea - Transparent outer covering that refracts light. 2. Lens - Adjusts its shape to focus images. 3. Retina - Light-sensitive layer where images form. 4. Iris - Controls amount of light entering eye. 5. Optic Nerve - Carries visual signals to brain. Functions include: focusing objects at different distances adaptation to light intensity and color perception.
