Answer Briefly,What is meant by thermal equilibrium?,When two bodies at different temperatures are placed in contact they exchange heat until both reach the same temperature. This state is called thermal equilibrium.
Answer Briefly,Define specific heat capacity.,Specific heat capacity is the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of a substance by 1 K or 1°C.
Answer in Detail,Explain the different types of heat transfer.,Heat transfer occurs in three ways: 1. Conduction: Transfer of heat through matter without actual movement of particles. Example: Heat transfer through metal rod. 2. Convection: Transfer of heat through actual movement of particles in fluids. Example: Sea breeze formation. 3. Radiation: Transfer of heat through electromagnetic waves requiring no medium. Example: Heat from the Sun reaching Earth.
Answer in Detail,Describe the effects of heat on matter.,Effects of heat on matter include: 1. Rise in temperature: Increases kinetic energy of particles. 2. Change in size: Thermal expansion in solids liquids and gases. 3. Change in state: Melting freezing vaporization and condensation. 4. Change in physical properties: Electrical resistance viscosity etc.
