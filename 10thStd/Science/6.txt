It is measured in atomic mass units (amu). Molecular mass is the sum of atomic masses of all atoms in a molecule. For example: H2O molecular mass = 2(1) + 16 = 18 amu. CO2 molecular mass = 12 + 2(16) = 44 amu.{next}Describe Avogadro's number and its significance.{ans}Avogadro's number (6.023 × 1023) represents the number of particles in one mole of any substance. Significance: 1. It helps convert between mass and number of particles. 2. It allows calculation of molecular mass from atomic mass. 3. It helps in chemical calculations involving gases liquids and solids. 4. It bridges the gap between microscopic and macroscopic measurements.
