Fill in the Blanks,The pairs of contrasting characters are called _______.,alleles
Fill in the Blanks,The genetic makeup of an organism is called _______.,genotype
Fill in the Blanks,The physical and chemical properties of genes are present in _______.,DNA
Fill in the Blanks,The process of changes in allele frequencies in population is called _______.,genetic drift

True or False,Genes are the functional units of inheritance.,True
True or False,Dominant alleles can express themselves in heterozygous condition.,True
True or False,Phenotype is influenced by environment.,True
True or False,DNA is a single-stranded molecule.,False
True or False,Mutation can create new alleles in a population.,True
Answer Briefly,What is heredity?,Heredity is the transmission of genetic characteristics from parents to offspring through genes.
Answer Briefly,Define phenotype.,Phenotype is the physical appearance or observable characteristics of an organism as a result of its genotype.
Answer Briefly,What are alleles?,Alleles are alternative forms of the same gene that occupy the same position (locus) on homologous chromosomes.
Answer in Detail,Explain Mendel's laws of inheritance.,Mendel's laws of inheritance: 1. Law of Dominance - one trait masks the other 2. Law of Segregation - allele pairs separate during gamete formation 3. Law of Independent Assortment - genes for different traits assort independently. Examples and ratios in monohybrid cross (3:1) and dihybrid cross (9:3:3:1).
Answer in Detail,Describe the structure and function of DNA.,DNA structure and function: 1. Double helix structure with sugar-phosphate backbone 2. Four bases - Adenine Thymine Guanine Cytosine 3. Base pairing A-T and G-C 4. Carries genetic information 5. Controls protein synthesis through transcription and translation. Functions include heredity information storage and gene expression.
