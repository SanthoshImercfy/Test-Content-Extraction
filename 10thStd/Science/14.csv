Fill in the Blanks,The brain is covered by three protective coverings collectively called _______.,meninges
Fill in the Blanks,The nerve impulse travels from _______ to _______.,dendrite to axon end
Fill in the Blanks,_______ is the longest cell in our body.,Nerve cell
Fill in the Blanks,The fluid filled between the meninges is called _______.,cerebrospinal fluid
Fill in the Blanks,The region of control of our hunger thirst and temperature regulation is _______.,hypothalamus
True or False,Medulla oblongata controls involuntary actions.,True
True or False,The brain is the longest part of our body.,False
True or False,Cerebrospinal fluid provides nutrition to the brain.,True
True or False,The human nervous system is divided into the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system.,True
True or False,Reflex actions are controlled by the brain.,False
Answer Briefly,What is a synapse?,A synapse is a junction between two neurons where information is passed from one neuron to another through chemical signals.
Answer Briefly,Define reflex action.,A reflex action is a sudden automatic response to a stimulus that occurs without conscious thought controlled by the spinal cord.
Answer Briefly,What is a neuron?,A neuron is the structural and functional unit of the nervous system specialized to transmit nerve impulses.
Answer in Detail,Explain the structure and functions of the human brain.,Human brain structure and functions: 1. Cerebrum - controls voluntary actions memory thinking and intelligence 2. Cerebellum - maintains posture and balance 3. Medulla oblongata - controls involuntary actions like heartbeat breathing 4. Hypothalamus - regulates body temperature hunger thirst 5. Thalamus - relay center for sensory signals.
Answer in Detail,Describe the types of neurons and their functions.,Types of neurons: 1. Sensory neurons - carry impulses from sense organs to CNS 2. Motor neurons - carry impulses from CNS to effector organs 3. Association neurons - connect sensory and motor neurons. Structure includes dendrites cell body axon and nerve endings. Functions include conducting nerve impulses processing information and maintaining communication between body parts.
