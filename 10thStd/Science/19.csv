Answer Briefly,What is plant breeding?,Plant breeding is the science of changing the traits of plants to produce desired characteristics including higher yield disease resistance and better quality.
Answer Briefly,Define biotechnology.,Biotechnology is the use of living organisms or their components to produce products and processes useful to humans.
Answer Briefly,What is genetic engineering?,Genetic engineering is the direct manipulation of an organism's genes using biotechnology to create new combinations of genes.
Answer in Detail,Explain the applications of biotechnology in agriculture.,Applications of biotechnology in agriculture: 1. Development of disease-resistant crops 2. Production of high-yielding varieties 3. Creation of transgenic plants with improved traits 4. Tissue culture for rapid plant propagation 5. Biological control of pests and diseases. Examples include BT cotton golden rice and drought-resistant crops.
Answer in Detail,Describe the process and significance of tissue culture.,Tissue culture process and significance: 1. Selection of plant tissue (explant) 2. Sterilization and culture in artificial medium 3. Growth and multiplication of cells 4. Regeneration of complete plants 5. Hardening and transfer to soil. Benefits include rapid multiplication disease-free plants conservation of rare species and production of secondary metabolites.
