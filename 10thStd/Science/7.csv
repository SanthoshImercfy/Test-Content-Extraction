Fill in the Blanks,Atomic size _______ down the group.,increases
Fill in the Blanks,Electronegativity _______ across a period from left to right.,increases

Answer Briefly,What is periodicity?,The regular repetition of properties of elements in the periodic table is called periodicity.
Answer Briefly,Define atomic radius.,Atomic radius is half the distance between the nuclei of two adjacent atoms in the metallic crystal.
Answer in Detail,Explain the trends in atomic radius across periods and down groups.,Atomic radius trends: 1. Across period: Decreases from left to right due to increasing nuclear charge and same shell. 2. Down group: Increases due to addition of new shells. 3. Factors affecting: Nuclear charge number of shells and electron-electron repulsion. 4. Examples: In period 2 Li > Be > B > C > N > O > F. In group 1 Cs > Rb > K > Na > Li.
Answer in Detail,Describe the periodic trends in metallic and non-metallic character.,Metallic character: 1. Decreases across period due to increasing nuclear charge. 2. Increases down group due to increasing atomic size. Non-metallic character: 1. Increases across period due to increasing electron affinity. 2. Decreases down group due to decreasing electron affinity. Examples: Na is more metallic than Mg Al is more metallic than Si F is more non-metallic than Cl.
