{quesType}Answer Briefly{quesType}
{ques}What is meant by mechanics? How can it be classified?{ques}
{ans}Mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with the effect of force on bodies. It is divided into two branches namely statics and dynamics.{ans}
{next}
{ques}What is statics?{ques}
{ans}Statics deals with the bodies which are at rest under the action of forces.{ans}
{next}
{ques}What is dynamics?{ques}
{ans}Dynamics is the study of moving bodies under the action of forces.{ans}
{next}
{ques}What is Kinematics?{ques}
{ans}Kinematics deals with the motion of bodies without considering the cause of motion.{ans}
{next}
{ques}What is Kinetics?{ques}
{ans}Kinetics deals with the motion of bodies considering the cause of motion.{ans}
{quesType}Answer in Detail{quesType}
{ques}Define momentum and state its unit.{ques}
{ans}The product of mass and velocity of a moving body gives the magnitude of linear momentum. It acts in the direction of the velocity of the object. Its S.I unit is kg ms-1.{ans}
{next}
{ques}Explain the inherent property of inertia and its classifications.{ques}
{ans}The inherent property of a body to resist any change in its state of rest or the state of uniform motion, unless it is influenced upon by an external unbalanced force, is known as 'inertia'. It can be classified into: 1. Inertia of rest, 2. Inertia of motion, 3. Inertia of direction.{ans}
{next}
{ques}State the effects of force.{ques}
{ans}1. Produces or tries to produce the motion of a static body.
2. Stops or tries to stop a moving body.
3. Changes or tries to change the direction of motion of a moving body.{ans}
{next}
{ques}State and explain principle of moments.{ques}
{ans}When a number of like or unlike parallel forces act on a rigid body and the body is in equilibrium, then the algebraic sum of the moments in the clockwise direction is equal to the algebraic sum of the moments in the anticlockwise direction. In other words, at equilibrium, the algebraic sum of the moments of all the individual forces about any point is equal to zero.{ans}
