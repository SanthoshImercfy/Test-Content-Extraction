Inertia of rest - The inability of a body to change its state of rest by itself. Example: When a bus starts suddenly passengers fall backward. 2. Inertia of motion - The inability of a body to change its state of uniform motion by itself. Example: When a running bus stops suddenly passengers fall forward. 3. Inertia of direction - The inability of a body to change its direction of motion by itself. Example: When a stone tied to a string is rotated in a circle and if the string breaks the stone flies off tangentially.{ans}{next}{ques}State Newton's laws of motion.{ques}{ans}Newton's First Law: Every body continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion along a straight line unless it is compelled by an external force to change that state. Newton's Second Law: The force acting on a body is directly proportional to the rate of change of momentum of the body and takes place in the direction in which the force acts. Newton's Third Law: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.{ans}{next}{ques}Derive the equation of force using Newton's second law.{ques}{ans}According to Newton's second law Force = Rate of change of momentum. Momentum = mass × velocity. For constant mass Force = mass × acceleration. Therefore F = ma where F is force m is mass and a is acceleration.{ans}{next}{ques}What are the different types of forces?{ques}{ans}The different types of forces are: 1. Contact forces - Forces that act when bodies are in physical contact. Examples: Normal force friction muscular force tension force. 2. Non-contact forces - Forces that act when bodies are not in physical contact. Examples: Gravitational force electromagnetic force nuclear force.{ans}{next}{ques}Explain the applications of torque.{ques}{ans}Applications of torque include: 1. Opening and closing of doors - The farther you push from the hinges the less force needed due to greater torque. 2. Wrenches and screwdrivers - Longer handles provide more torque making it easier to turn nuts and screws. 3. Steering wheels - Large diameter allows for easier turning with less force. 4. Gears in machines - Different sized gears create different torques for various mechanical advantages.{ans}
