This state is called thermal equilibrium.{next}Define specific heat capacity.{ans}Specific heat capacity is the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of a substance by 1 K or 1°C.{quesType}Answer in Detail{ques}Explain the different types of heat transfer.{ans}Heat transfer occurs in three ways: 1. Conduction: Transfer of heat through matter without actual movement of particles. Example: Heat transfer through metal rod. 2. Convection: Transfer of heat through actual movement of particles in fluids. Example: Sea breeze formation. 3. Radiation: Transfer of heat through electromagnetic waves requiring no medium. Example: Heat from the Sun reaching Earth.{next}Describe the effects of heat on matter.{ans}Effects of heat on matter include: 1. Rise in temperature: Increases kinetic energy of particles. 2. Change in size: Thermal expansion in solids liquids and gases. 3. Change in state: Melting freezing vaporization and condensation. 4. Change in physical properties: Electrical resistance viscosity etc.
