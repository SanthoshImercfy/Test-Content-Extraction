Fill in the Blanks,Atoms of different elements having same mass number but different atomic numbers are called _______.,isobars
Fill in the Blanks,Atoms of different elements having same number of _______ are called isotones.,neutrons
Fill in the Blanks,Atoms of one element can be transmuted into atoms of other element by _______.,artificial transmutation
Fill in the Blanks,The sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons of an atom is called its _______.,mass number
Fill in the Blanks,The average atomic mass of hydrogen is _______ amu.,1.008
True or False,One gram of C-12 contains Avogadro's number of atoms.,False
True or False,One mole of oxygen gas contains Avogadro's number of molecules.,True
True or False,One mole of hydrogen gas contains Avogadro's number of atoms.,True

Answer Briefly,What is atomicity?,The number of atoms present in a molecule is called its atomicity.
Answer Briefly,Define mole.,A mole is the amount of a substance that contains as many elementary particles as there are atoms in exactly 12 grams of carbon-12.
Answer in Detail,Explain the concept of atomic mass and molecular mass.,Atomic mass is the mass of an atom relative to 1/12th the mass of a carbon-12 atom. It is measured in atomic mass units (amu). Molecular mass is the sum of atomic masses of all atoms in a molecule. For example: H2O molecular mass = 2(1) + 16 = 18 amu. CO2 molecular mass = 12 + 2(16) = 44 amu.
Answer in Detail,Describe Avogadro's number and its significance.,Avogadro's number (6.023 × 1023) represents the number of particles in one mole of any substance. Significance: 1. It helps convert between mass and number of particles. 2. It allows calculation of molecular mass from atomic mass. 3. It helps in chemical calculations involving gases liquids and solids. 4. It bridges the gap between microscopic and macroscopic measurements.
