Answer in Detail,Explain the types of inertia with examples.,There are three types of inertia: 1. Inertia of rest - The inability of a body to change its state of rest by itself. Example: When a bus starts suddenly passengers fall backward. 2. Inertia of motion - The inability of a body to change its state of uniform motion by itself. Example: When a running bus stops suddenly passengers fall forward. 3. Inertia of direction - The inability of a body to change its direction of motion by itself. Example: When a stone tied to a string is rotated in a circle and if the string breaks the stone flies off tangentially.
Answer in Detail,State Newton's laws of motion.,Newton's First Law: Every body continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion along a straight line unless it is compelled by an external force to change that state. Newton's Second Law: The force acting on a body is directly proportional to the rate of change of momentum of the body and takes place in the direction in which the force acts. Newton's Third Law: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
Answer in Detail,Derive the equation of force using Newton's second law.,According to Newton's second law Force = Rate of change of momentum. Momentum = mass × velocity. For constant mass Force = mass × acceleration. Therefore F = ma where F is force m is mass and a is acceleration.
Answer in Detail,What are the different types of forces?,The different types of forces are: 1. Contact forces - Forces that act when bodies are in physical contact. Examples: Normal force friction muscular force tension force. 2. Non-contact forces - Forces that act when bodies are not in physical contact. Examples: Gravitational force electromagnetic force nuclear force.
Answer in Detail,Explain the applications of torque.,Applications of torque include: 1. Opening and closing of doors - The farther you push from the hinges the less force needed due to greater torque. 2. Wrenches and screwdrivers - Longer handles provide more torque making it easier to turn nuts and screws. 3. Steering wheels - Large diameter allows for easier turning with less force. 4. Gears in machines - Different sized gears create different torques for various mechanical advantages.
