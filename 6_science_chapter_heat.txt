{ques}What are the three ways of heat transfer?
{ans}The three ways of heat transfer are:
1. Conduction - Transfer of heat through solid materials
2. Convection - Transfer of heat through liquids and gases by actual movement of particles
3. Radiation - Transfer of heat through electromagnetic waves
{next}

{ques}Why are metals good conductors of heat?
{ans}Metals are good conductors of heat because:
1. They have free electrons that can easily transfer energy
2. Their atoms are closely packed
3. They have high thermal conductivity
{next}

{ques}What is the use of a thermos flask?
{ans}A thermos flask is used to keep hot liquids hot and cold liquids cold by preventing heat transfer through:
1. Double-walled glass container with vacuum between walls to prevent conduction and convection
2. Silvered walls to prevent radiation
3. Plastic/cork stopper to prevent heat loss from the top
