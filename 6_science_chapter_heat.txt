{ques}Borosilicate glass do not expand much on being heated.
{ans}True
{next}

Answer Briefly
{ques}Why does an ordinary glass bottle crack when boiling water is poured into it, but a borosilicate glass bottle does not?
{ans}The reason is that the borosilicate glass does not expand much on being heated and therefore they do not crack.

{ques}Why do electric wires sag in summer and become straight in winter?
{ans}1. During summer thermal expansion takes place in electric wire
2. In winter it contracts so it becomes straight

Additional Questions
{ques}Explain thermal expansion with suitable examples.
{ans}Thermal expansion: The expansion of a substance on heating is called the thermal expansion of that substance.

Fitting the iron rim on the wooden wheel:
1. The diameter of the iron ring is slightly less than that of the wooden wheel
2. So, it cannot be easily slipped on from the rim of a wooden wheel
3. The iron ring is, therefore, first heated to a higher temperature so that it expands in size and the hot ring is then easily slipped over to the rim of the wooden wheel
4. Cold water is now poured on the iron ring so that it contracts in size and holds the wooden wheel tightly

Rivetting:
1. Rivets are used to join two steel plates together
2. Hot rivet is driven through the hole in the plates
3. One end of the rivet is hammered to form a new rivet head
4. When cooled, the rivet will contract and hold the two plates tightly together
{next}

{ques}Distinguish between heat and temperature.
{ans}Heat:
1. It is a form of energy
2. It flows from higher temperature to lower temperature
3. It is measured in joules
4. It is the total kinetic energy of molecules

Temperature:
1. It is the degree of hotness or coldness
2. It determines the direction of heat flow
3. It is measured in Kelvin or Celsius
4. It is the average kinetic energy of molecules
