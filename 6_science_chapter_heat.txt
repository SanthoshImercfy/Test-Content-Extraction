It determines the direction of heat flow between two bodies.{next}What are the three ways of heat transfer?{ans}The three ways of heat transfer are: 1. Conduction - Transfer of heat through solid materials 2. Convection - Transfer of heat through liquids and gases by actual movement of particles 3. Radiation - Transfer of heat through electromagnetic waves{next}Why are metals good conductors of heat?{ans}Metals are good conductors of heat because: 1. They have free electrons that can easily transfer energy 2. Their atoms are closely packed 3. They have high thermal conductivity{next}What is the use of a thermos flask?{ans}A thermos flask is used to keep hot liquids hot and cold liquids cold by preventing heat transfer through: 1. Double-walled glass container with vacuum between walls to prevent conduction and convection 2. Silvered walls to prevent radiation 3. Plastic/cork stopper to prevent heat loss from the top
