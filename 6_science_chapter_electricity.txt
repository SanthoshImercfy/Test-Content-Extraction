Additional Questions
{ques}What is the source of electricity? Explain the various power stations in India.
{ans}1. In thermal power stations:
- Thermal energy is generated by burning coal, diesel, or gas to produce steam
- Steam is used to rotate the turbine to generate electricity
- Here heat energy is converted into electric energy

2. In hydel power stations:
- The turbine is made to rotate by the flow of water from dams
- Here kinetic energy is converted into electric energy

3. In atomic power station:
- Nuclear energy is used to boil water
- The steam thus produced is used to rotate the turbine
- Here nuclear energy is converted into mechanical energy

4. In windmills:
- Wind energy is used to rotate turbines to produce electricity
- Here kinetic energy is converted into electrical energy

{ques}Write short notes on conductors and insulators.
{ans}Conductors:
- The rate of flow of electric charges in a circuit is called electric current
- The materials which allow electric charges to pass through them are called conductors
- Examples: Copper, iron, aluminum, impure water, earth, etc.

Insulators (Non-Conductors):
- The materials which do not allow electric charges to pass through them are called insulators or non-conductors
- Examples: plastic, glass, wood, rubber, china clay, ebonite, etc.

{ques}What is a cell? Explain the types of cells.
{ans}A device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy is called a cell. Cells are classified into two types:

1. Primary cells:
- They cannot be recharged
- They can be used only once
- They are small in size
- Examples: Cells used in clocks, watches, and toys

2. Secondary cells:
- A cell that can be recharged many times
- Depending upon usage size may vary
- Examples: Used in mobile phones, laptops, emergency lamps, and vehicle batteries
