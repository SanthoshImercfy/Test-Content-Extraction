It includes processes like: 1. Evaporation 2. Condensation 3. Precipitation 4. Collection. This cycle maintains water balance in nature.{next}List different methods of water purification.{ans}Common methods of water purification include: 1. Boiling 2. Filtration 3. Distillation 4. Chlorination 5. UV treatment 6. Reverse osmosis{next}What are the main causes of water pollution?{ans}Main causes of water pollution include: 1. Industrial waste discharge 2. Sewage disposal 3. Agricultural runoff 4. Oil spills 5. Plastic waste 6. Chemical contamination{next}Why is water conservation important?{ans}Water conservation is important because: 1. Only 3% of Earth's water is freshwater 2. Growing population increases water demand 3. Climate change affects water availability 4. Many regions face water scarcity 5. Clean water is essential for life{next}What are the different sources of water?{ans}Sources of water include: 1. Surface water (rivers, lakes, ponds) 2. Groundwater (wells, springs) 3. Rainwater 4. Glaciers 5. Oceans (after desalination) 6. Atmospheric water (clouds, water vapor)
