These changes are usually reversible.{next}Define chemical change.{ans}A chemical change is a change in which one or more new substances are formed with different properties from the original substance. These changes are usually irreversible and involve changes in the chemical composition of substances.{next}What are periodic changes? Give examples.{ans}Periodic changes are changes that occur repeatedly at regular intervals. Examples include: 1. Day and night cycle 2. Seasons 3. Phases of the moon 4. Heartbeat{next}Differentiate between fast and slow changes.{ans}Fast changes occur quickly in a short time, while slow changes take place over a longer period: Fast changes: Breaking of glass, bursting of crackers, burning of paper. Slow changes: Growth of plants, rusting of iron, formation of fossils{next}Why is burning of wood an irreversible change?{ans}Burning of wood is an irreversible change because: 1. It forms new substances (ash, smoke, and gases) 2. The chemical composition of wood changes 3. The original wood cannot be obtained back from its ash 4. It is a chemical change that cannot be reversed
