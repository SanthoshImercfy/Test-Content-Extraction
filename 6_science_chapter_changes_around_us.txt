Answer Briefly
{ques}What is a physical change?
{ans}A physical change is a change in which no new substance is formed and only the physical properties like shape, size, color, or state of the substance change. These changes are usually reversible.
{next}

{ques}Define chemical change.
{ans}A chemical change is a change in which one or more new substances are formed with different properties from the original substance. These changes are usually irreversible and involve changes in the chemical composition of substances.
