Additional Questions
{ques}How do plants and animals maintain the balance of oxygen and carbon-di-oxide in air?
{ans}1. Plants in forests release oxygen through the process of photosynthesis and help in providing oxygen to animals for respiration.
2. Plants consume carbon dioxide released by the animals. In this way, plants help in maintaining a balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

{ques}Why is the atmosphere essential for life on earth?
{ans}The atmosphere is essential for life because it maintains an appropriate climate for the maintenance of life by carrying out the following activities:
1. The atmosphere keeps the average temperature of the Earth fairly constant during the day time.
2. It prevents a sudden increase in temperature during the day time.
3. It also slows down the escape of heat from the surface of the Earth into outer space during the night time.

{ques}Can you guess why fire extinguishers throw a stream of carbon-di-oxide while putting off fire?
{ans}It is because carbon-di-oxide (CO2) does not support combustion. When sprayed on burning object it stops the supply of oxygen and controls the fire.
