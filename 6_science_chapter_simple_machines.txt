Answer Briefly
{ques}What are simple machines?
{ans}Simple machines are devices that:
1. Make work easier
2. Change the size or direction of force
3. Help us do work with less effort
4. Form the basis of all complex machines
5. Have been used since ancient times
{next}

{ques}Explain the three classes of levers.
{ans}The three classes of levers are:
1. First Class: Fulcrum between effort and load (e.g., seesaw)
2. Second Class: Load between fulcrum and effort (e.g., wheelbarrow)
3. Third Class: Effort between fulcrum and load (e.g., tweezers)
{next}

{ques}What are the uses of pulleys?
{ans}Pulleys are used for:
1. Lifting heavy loads
2. Changing direction of force
3. Reducing effort needed
4. Construction work
5. Flag hoisting
6. Elevators
{next}

{ques}How does an inclined plane make work easier?
{ans}An inclined plane makes work easier by:
1. Reducing the effort needed
2. Increasing the distance over which work is done
3. Making it easier to move loads to higher levels
4. Converting vertical movement to diagonal movement
5. Reducing friction

{ques}Give examples of simple machines in daily life.
{ans}Examples of simple machines in daily life:
1. Lever: Scissors, bottle opener, see-saw
2. Pulley: Flag pole, elevator, crane
3. Wheel and axle: Bicycle, door knob, steering wheel
4. Inclined plane: Ramp, slide, staircase
